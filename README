When I was learning python I had to go all over the web to find the examples I needed. I decided to put some common examples here to make it easier for other who are learning python to find. If these scripts are helpful or if you have suggestions for other examples that should be added, please let me know.

This is not meant to be a python tutorial. If you need a tutorial please check out the following resources:
 - http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html
 - http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python
 - http://learnpythonthehardway.org/
 
Examples:
read_file.py - opens a file, reads each line, and processes the line.
write_file.py - write data to a file
read_write_file.py - opens two files, read from one, write to the other

Coming Soon:
server.py - python server with sockets
client.py - python client with sockets
